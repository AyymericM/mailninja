# Mail Ninja
A simple web-based anonymous mail sender built with React and NodeJS

#### NOTE: The server won't work on Windows for an unknown reason :(

See the live version here: https://apps.aymericm.fr/mailninja

## How to install and run:

The app is composed of two source codes: the client, in React located in the root folder and the server, located in the `server` folder.

You need to start the server first, then the client.

#### Here is how you can start the app:

Start the server:

```sh
# you need to be in the server folder to start the server
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

Start the client:

```sh
# you need to be in the root folder to start the client
npm install
npm start
```

Then your browser should open with live reload !
